/* DSR command ring between the game's DirectDraw layer (producer) and the Metal renderer thread (consumer).
 * Layout: header, then a ring of DSR_RING_SIZE bytes of command records (dsr_proto.h).
 * Positions are free-running 32-bit byte counts (the ring size divides 2^32); ring offset = pos % DSR_RING_SIZE. A record never wraps:
 * if it doesn't fit before the end, the producer writes a DSR_WRAP header (or nothing, if < 8 bytes remain) and
 * continues at offset 0. All cross-process fields are naturally aligned and accessed with acquire/release semantics. */
